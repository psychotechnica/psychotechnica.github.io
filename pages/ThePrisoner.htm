<p> 
Today I learn of the passing of Patrick McGoohan. It may be only those age 50++ who remember the two TV series in which he starred - "Secret Agent Man" (in the U.S., "Danger Man" in the U.K.), and soon thereafter, "The Prisoner".

<p> 
These shows of the late 1960's were born steeped in the culture of cold-war espionage, as were their contemporaries such as the James Bond franchise, the TV shows "The Avengers" and "I Spy", and even the comical "Get Smart".

<p> 
In "Secret Agent", our man plays a spy for "the western powers of goodness and right" against the evil agendas of "the east" (communist countries and various dictators in general). The lines were well drawn, you knew for whom to root and cheer, and you can bet the good guys always won - as was the case in all "espionage-based" TV and movie thrillers of the period.

<p> 
When "The Prisoner" soon followed, it presented the familiar drive and intensity, a heart-pounding introduction to a new world of thrilling subterfuge. In the series opener, our man drives his custom built sports car into the underground garage of a tall building in London, and soon is seen marching angrily down a hallway and bursting into someone's office, thrusting open the office double-doors to the sound of thunder, stomping and pointing and admonishing the silent civil servant behind the desk (All of this to intense and imposing music, punctuated appropriately with the sounds of thunder - you hear no voices). Finally, he slams his letter of resignation upon the desk, and is seen driving away toward his London flat.



<p> 
In the flat, you see our man packing a suitcase, while outside a long black limo pulls up, a very tall and gaunt man in black tuxedo and top-hat, head held high and sporting a long black cane, saunters up to the front door, and from the inside we see green gas pouring in through the keyhole.

<p> 
Our man begins to feel the effects. Reeling, he turns to gaze out through the blinds of his window onto the London skyline, then falls onto the nearby bed and passes out.

<p> 
We see him awake, groggy, on the same bed, with the same pictures on the wall - but the window blinds are closed. He gets up, still shaken and confused, to open the blinds ... SHOCK! He is no longer in London!!!

<p> 
The phone beside him rings. Warily, he answers:

And so begins a mind-bending sequence of 17 episodes, each serving to invert your notions of "us" and "them", and most of all to explore the meanings of individual and society, what it means to be "free", and what one must relinquish to be accepted as a member of society. In my view, the series is a metaphor depicting the internal contradictions that must exist when a society - by definition a construct requiring conformities - claims to hold the free will of the individual in foremost regard. I feel the series was brilliantly conceived and executed, its closure both triumphant and twisted, a timeless work to be cherished.

<p>
[P.S. I should have mentioned, more than merely acting out the cat/mouse role of the prisoner impeccably, McGoohan was the Executive Producer and co-writer/creator of the series. I believe he felt very deeply about the issues portrayed - a fine accomplishment.]

<p> 
For those interested, the series was filmed almost entirely at the resort in Portmeirion, Wales, its quaint and colorful buildings forever a reminder of the peculiar tale of The Prisoner. Some links:
