<p>
<font face="arial"> Lest I be misunderstood in discussing an "optimal" recumbent bicycle, I should clarify that I intend to mean a recumbent "for the masses",
intended primarily for leisurely street and (somewhat) sporty touring considerations.  I am not addressing the ultimate land speed record recumbent,
not the ultimate recumbent mountain bike.</font>
<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 1.0 - Bicycle Geometry and Stability </b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial"> 
The standard "upright" bicycle has reached a degree of near perfection.  A well-made touring bicycle 
is an object of grace, performing the tasks demanded of it almost effortlessly.  The fact that you 
can pilot a good bicycle hands free (not recommended) and even control gentle steering through 
minor shifts of weight and acceleration are a testament to the fine degree of balance the modern 
bicycle has achieved.
<p>
The goal of this exposition is to achieve this same degree of natural riding experience in a recumbent.
<p>
To understand the difficulties associated with this goal, we need to understand what makes
a standard bicycle behave the way that it does.  Three of the major qualities of bicycle geometry 
that make a bicycle ride naturally are
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Steering Castor
<LI> Steering Lift
<LI> Counter-Canting Steer
</UL> 

<p>
We take each of these in turn, and illustrate how they come together to produce a well-balanced machine.<br>

<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 1.1 - Steering Castor </b></font>
<p>
<p>
<font face="arial"> 
Take any good upright bicycle, hold it in the straight and vertical position,
turn the front wheel slightly, and then push the bicycle forward from the seat.  
Notice that the front wheel immediately tends to straighten toward the direction 
of motion.  This effect is due to what is called positive steering castor, or positive 
steering trail, and is evidenced primarily during acceleration.  Figure 1 below 
illustrates steering castor.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-1a.png" alt="Negative Castor"> </center>
<p>
The measure of steering castor, or trail, is given by the displacement 
of the steering head point (the extension of the steering  tube axis to 
the ground) with respect to the wheel contact point with the ground.  
(A more accurate measure, from the standpoint of physics, would be 
the horizontal component of the displacement from the wheel contact 
point to the point on the steering head axis that is orthogonal to the axis, 
called the steering trail normal.  However, either they are both positive, 
or both negative.)  Figure 1a illustrates the effect of negative trail - as 
the bicycle accelerates forward, a small degree of steering will tend to 
become more severe, and the rider would need to exert additional effort 
against the direction of steer to keep the wheel tracking along the intended heading.
<p>
Figures 1b and 1c both illustrate positive trail, whereby acceleration tends 
the straighten the wheel to align with the direction of motion.  This effect 
exists because a non-spinning wheel does not want to begin spinning on its 
own - one must overcome the wheel's rotational inertia to give it rotational 
(angular) momentum.  The resistance to the gain in angular momentum is 
experienced by the wheel as if the ground is trying to drag the wheel toward 
the rear.  The ground is essentially "grabbing" the wheel at its ground contact 
point and pulling it backwards.  This will tend to straighten the wheel if the 
ground contact point is already behind the steering head point, but will move 
it further from straight otherwise.
<p>

<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-1c.png" alt="Positive Castor"> </center>
<p>
Note that once a bicycle is moving forward in a straight heading at a constant 
speed, there is virtually no such "acceleration drag" affecting the front wheel 
(unless you have very bad wheel bearings).  Hence, steering trail has only little 
to do with a bicycle's stability while coasting.</font>

<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 1.2 - Steering Lift </b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial"> 
Refer again to figures 1b and 1c above.  Both of these illustrate (good) positive 
steering trail, but they have poor steering lift (actually, 1c has negative steering lift, 
while 1b will exhibit negative steering lift as the bike is canted into a turn.)  
Steering lift refers to the degree to which the bicycle frame (or its center of gravity) 
either rises or falls as the wheel is turned.  Take a good upright bicycle, hold it in 
the straight and vertical position from the frame near the steering tube, and then 
turn the wheel 45 degrees.  You should notice that the frame has risen slightly, 
and that by pushing downward on the frame you will tend to cause the wheel to 
straighten and diminish the steering.  This effect is due to a combination of two 
factors - the steering head angle (often called the rake angle) and the steering 
"offset", being the orthogonal distance from the steering axis line to the wheel center.  
I will refer to this distance as the "steering radius".
<p>
With small but positive steering lift, a rider should feel a slight pressure resisting 
the direction of steer.  With negative steering lift, as the rider begins a turn, their 
own weight will tend to cause the wheel to "steer ahead" of their effort, or over-steer, 
and they must exert force against the direction of their intended steer in order to keep 
the steer from becoming greater than their intent.  Figure 2a illustrates (severe) negative 
steering lift.  If you attempted to ride such a bike "hands-free", and the wheel begins 
to turn, it will suddenly turn violently, despite the fact that this configuration has "great" steering trail.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-2a.png" alt="Negative Steering Lift"> </center>
<p>
Whenever there is no steering offset (steering radius = 0), and any amount of rake 
(rake angle) to provide for positive steering trail, there will be negative steering lift.  
This is because, with any rake angle, the wheel is only vertical when pointed straight 
ahead, and must depart from vertical as steering is applied.  This causes the wheel 
center to drop closer to the ground.  A steering offset which places the center of the 
front wheel above the line of the steering head axis can serve to counter negative 
steering lift caused by the canting of the wheel (figure 2b).  As the wheel is steered, 
the front wheel center "orbits" backward and downward around the steering axis.  
The center of this orbit (depicted in green) is a point on the steering axis I will call 
the "steering center".  With respect to the wheel center, the steering center must rise, 
and with it the frame of the bicycle, as steering is effected.  In essence, the "offset" 
represented by the steering radius allows the wheel center to drop as the wheel 
cants over during a steer, while the steering center point can remain at a near-constant elevation.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-2b.png" alt="Offset-Compensated Steering Lift"> </center>
<p>
The precise amount of steering offset (steering radius) that will cancel negative 
steering lift depends upon the rake angle and the wheel radius.  In general, the 
greater the rake angle (the more it departs from vertical) the more offset is needed 
to avoid a large negative steering lift.  A "good bicycle" will have nearly flat steering lift, 
and tend to grow slowly as steering increases.  With too much steering lift, the rider 
must exert excessive force in order to steer at all, as they are lifting themselves against gravity.
<p>
<ul><b>Is It Front Wheel or Rear Wheel Steering?</b></ul>
<p>
Finally, it must be mentioned that when a bicycle has any amount of steering offset, 
it is no longer exactly true to say that the bike has (say) front-wheel steering, or 
rear-wheel steering.  In truth, both wheels are contributing to the steering.  Just as 
we can define the Front Steering Radius (FSR) to be the perpendicular distance 
from the steering axis to the center of the front wheel, we can define the Rear 
Steering Radius (RSR) to be the perpendicular distance from the steering axis to 
the center of the rear wheel, as shown in figure 2c.  Since (with a standard bicycle) 
the RSR is so large in comparison to the FSR, steering the front wheel 45 degrees 
to the right will only cause the rear wheel to "steer" 3 or 4 degrees to the left.  
(As we will see later on, it makes more sense to define front wheel steering as 
any configuration where the rider's seat remains stationary with respect to the 
frame of the rear wheel.)

<p>
<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 1.3 - Counter-Canting Steer</b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial"> 
To get a sense of counter-canting steer, imagine you are riding at a good speed on a 
curved road in a constant and gentle right-hand turn.  Naturally, you and the bicycle 
are slightly canted (leaning) to the right, toward the direction of the center of your 
turning circle, to maintain constant balance.  Up ahead, you can see that the road 
will soon straighten, and you must prepare to eliminate this lean and bring the 
bicycle upright.  How do you "un-cant" yourself?
<p>
There are two ways to accomplish this.  One way is to accelerate, because as you 
travel along any circle, increasing your tangential velocity will increase the effective 
outward centrifugal force.  Another way is to momentarily increase the degree of 
rightward steering, as this will cause the bicycle to begin tracking a smaller turning 
circle, and (again) increase the effective outward centrifugal force.
<p>
But this is not the whole story.  Consider a bicycle with "naive" rear-wheel steering 
(where the RSR is smaller than the FSR).  To maintain the same gentle right-hand 
turn described in the previous paragraph, the rear wheel is steered to the left.  If the 
steering is momentarily increased (the rear wheel is turned further to the left), the 
bicycle is indeed "tracking a smaller turning circle", and must eventually produce a 
greater outward force.  But the immediate effect is that the rear wheel is initially 
tracking this new circle to the left, causing the cant of the bicycle to increase rather 
than decrease, until the rear of the bike swings around to the far side of this new 
turning circle.  This is a very unsettling and counter-intuitive effect.
<p>
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-3a.png" alt="Constant Turn"> </center>

<p>
Figure 3 illustrates what is really happening with standard front wheel steer 
(where FSR < RSR) and "naive" rear wheel steer (where RSR < FSR).  
Figure 3a represents a bicycle in a constant right-hand turn.  I have purposely 
drawn it so that both the front and rear wheels are tracking the same turning 
circle, leaving it ambiguous as to whether this is front wheel or rear wheel steering.  
Notice that you find the center of the turning circle at the intersection of the two 
vertical planes (green lines) containing the ground contact points of the front and 
rear wheels, and each perpendicular to the tracking direction of the respective 
wheels.  The red line, denoted the "turning arm", connects the center of the turning 
circle to the bicycle's center of gravity, and the blue arrow indicates the direction 
of the bicycle's current heading (direction of momentum).  (If the bike were to hit 
"frictionless ice" at this moment, the bike would slide along the blue line.)  Note 
that the blue momentum line is exactly tangential to the current turning circle, 
and perpendicular to the turning "arm".

<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-3b.png" alt="Front Wheel Steering"> </center>

<p>
Figure 3b shows what happens with front wheel steering, if the rider suddenly 
increases the amount of rightward steer (and the tires do not slide.)  Notice that 
not only has the new turning circle gotten smaller, its center has moved *behind* 
the red line of the previous turning circle.  This means that the bicycle's current 
momentum line is no longer tangential to the new turning circle, but is actually 
heading *away* from the circle, and away from the tangent heading of the new 
turning arm.  This effect is what is immediately responsible for lifting the bike up 
from its current canting angle, and is what I will define as <b>Counter-Canting Steer</b>.  
Importantly, note that suddenly turning the wheel provides the bike a new "tangent heading", 
but does not immediately alter the momentum heading.

<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/bgeom-3c.png" alt="Rear Wheel Steering"> </center>

<p>
Figure 3c shows what happens with (naive) rear wheel steering, if the rider 
suddenly increases the amount of leftward steer to the rear wheel to force a 
"sharper" right turn.  Again, the new turning circle has gotten smaller, but now 
its center has moved *ahead* of the red line of the previous turning circle.  
This means that the bicycle's current momentum line is carrying the bicycle 
*into* the new circle (compared to the new tangent heading) rather than 
away from it.  This is what will cause the bike's canting angle initially to *increase*.

<p>
It should be clear from these diagrams that one must have FSR < RSR 
(modulo rake angle) in order to have counter-canting steer.  Specifically, 
with the bike canted into a turn, extend the steering head axis to the ground 
and call this the "steering head point".  This point also lies on the intersections 
of the lines representing the directions of the front and rear wheel tracks.  
The line segment connecting the front wheel contact point to the steering 
head point, and the segment connecting the rear wheel contact point to the 
steering head point, are essentially the "shadows" cast by the FSR and the 
RSR upon the ground, if light shines down in parallel to the steering head axis.  
It is actually the FSR-shadow that must be shorter than the RSR-shadow 
that is required to have counter-canting steer.

<p>
<b>Wheel Diameter</b>
<p>
Another property that upright bicycles enjoy is the ability to easily 
accommodate large wheel diameters on a relatively short wheelbase.  
Having large wheel diameters provides two benefits.  First, it allows 
the bicycle to moderate the jarring effect of small bumps in the roadway, 
thus lessening the need for suspension.  Figure 4 depicts a 15" and 30" 
wheel encountering a 2" curb.  Note that upon "impact", the path of the 
smaller wheel center must make a larger instantaneous change of trajectory 
(red arrow) in order to ride up and over the curb.  A second benefit is 
added gyroscopic stability at high speed.  (If you can find a long, steep, 
well-paved and isolated roadway, take a good 26-inch bike to top 
speed on a downhill run.  As you approach 50-60 MPH, try to 
"recklessly" swerve the bike left and right - it is almost impossible.  
As far as steering and canting goes, the bike acts like it is moving 
through molasses.)
<p>

<p>
In summary (so far), one can appreciate why the standard upright 
bicycle, with its moderate rake angle (as measured from vertical), 
its moderate steering offset (FSR) and moderate trail come together 
to forge the finely balanced machine that so many people enjoy.  
Any bicycle, be it front or rear wheel steer, front or rear wheel drive, 
upright or recumbent, cannot stray far from a careful relationship 
among these settings and produce a "naturally" rideable machine.

<p>
With these considerations (and some others) in mind, let us set forth 
to design the "ultimate" recumbent bicycle.<br>

<p>

<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 2.0 - Recumbent Position Pros and Cons </b></font>
<p>
<font face="arial"> 
To begin, I should reiterate that my goal here is not the ultimate recumbent 
for professional racing, but rather to develop a recumbent bike for the casual 
touring cyclist, while retaining much of the "sporty" handling of a fine upright bicycle.

<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-5ab-generic.png" alt="Generic Rider Positions"> </center>

<p>
Refer to figure 5 to compare the general orientation of the rider, in the upright 
versus recumbent positions.  Each position has positive and negative attributes, 
independent of the particular bike being ridden.  Let us consider some of these:
<p>
<UL><B> A - Aerodynamics </B></UL>
<p>
Here, the recumbent generally provides better aerodynamics, as there is less 
frontal area exposed.  To approach a similar degree of aerodynamic in an upright, 
the rider must double over into the "racing position", which requires the rider to 
carry their upper weight on doubled-up arms, and to crane their neck backwards 
in order to see forward.
<p>
<UL><B> B - Rider-Assisted Balance </B></UL>
<p>
Almost anyone can balance a 6-foot broom-handle upright on the tip of a finger.  
Try to do the same thing with a 6-inch pencil, and you can appreciate why 
"tallness is good" when it comes to maintaining balance.  The upright rider can 
adjust their weight and position easily to control the bicycle in motion.  
This is more difficult for the recumbent rider, especially with recumbents 
that seem to strive for the "limits of lowness" in rider position.  For this reason, 
having good "inherent balance" in a bicycle's geometry could be said to be 
more important for a recumbent than for an upright bicycle.
<p>
<UL><B> C - Cardio-Vascular </B></UL>
<p>
In the upright position, the legs receive superior blood-flow, and one can argue 
that humans have evolved to conduct most all of their heavy exertion in the upright 
position (with certain horizontal exceptions ... ).  Some recumbent riders complain 
of numbness in their feet or toes after a long ride.  For this reason, a "good" 
recumbent would sacrifice some of that horizontal streamlining for a slightly 
rider-canted position (pedal crank lower than the rider's seat).  Of course, 
the head and torso receive better blood-flow in a recumbent position.
<p>
<UL><B> D - Rider-Assisted Suspension </B></UL>
<p>
When encountering a patch of rocky roadway, the (alert) upright rider can 
lift themselves off the seat, and use their legs as shock absorbers, lessening 
impact upon the body (and lessening the chance of wheel damage).  
In contrast, the recumbent bicycle must carry the rider's full weight at all times.  
This makes full-suspension more a necessity than a luxury for the recumbent, 
adding weight to the frame.
<p>
<UL><B> E - Comfort </B></UL>
<p>
The well-designed recumbent is the clear winner here, as one of the main 
motivations for recumbent bicycles is to provide the casual rider with a more 
comfortable riding experience.  Even the best upright touring bike requires 
that the rider's upper body be canted a bit forward, and support a bit of 
this upper-body weight on the arms.  This can become tiring on long outings, 
and the forward cant of the upper body means that the neck must continuously 
lift the head up and backwards to look forward at a natural angle.  The recumbent 
addresses all of these issues well, but at the price of a (typically) heavier bicycle, 
requiring full suspension and a larger seat to support the upper back.
<p>
<UL><B> F - Speed </B></UL>
<p>
Arguably, a recumbent designed for speed can exceed the speeds achievable 
from an upright bicycle.  With a recumbent, the full force of a rider's legs can 
be applied between the pedals and the back of the rider's seat, and most people 
can "leg press" far more than their own weight.  It is said that an upright rider 
can only exert pedal force equal to their own weight.  While this is not entirely 
true (the rider can "lift upward" on the handle bars while pressing down with 
the legs) this can quickly become an exhausting proposition, and can interfere 
with steering control.  However, the salient question here is whether one can 
obtain speed from a "casual" touring recumbent, comparable to that of a similar 
upright.  I think the answer is a qualified "yes", depending upon the specifics 
of the recumbent design.
<p>
There is little that can be done for the upright bicycle that would serve to mitigate 
its shortcomings.  It can be argued that the recumbent position has as many, 
or more shortcomings, overall.  However, recumbent designs allow for greater 
flexibility that can serve to mitigate most of these issues.  Consider figure 5b, 
where I have intentionally drawn an ambiguous (almost impossible) recumbent 
position - the pedal crank would have to pass through the front wheel.  
Having to "design around" this particular difficulty is responsible for much of 
the variety one sees in recumbent designs.  As we shall see, these design 
"solutions" often lead to their own unique drawbacks, and further unique solutions.

<p>
<b>Terminology</b>
<p>
Recumbent bicycle designs can be divided several ways, the most common being
<p>
<UL>
<LI> RWD versus FWD  (Rear Wheel Drive versus Front Wheel Drive)
<LI> LWB versus SWB  (Long Wheelbase versus Short Wheelbase)
</UL>
and to a less common extent
<UL> 
<LI> FWS versus RWS  (Front Wheel Steer versus Rear Wheel Steer)
</UL> 

<p>
Below, I depict (figuratively) each of these designs (or their most common 
implementations) and discuss what I feel are the gains and losses associated 
with each.  I begin with the Rear Wheel Drive designs, then move on to 
Front Wheel Drive and then "Rear Wheel Steer", as this order provides a 
nice sequence of problem-solution-problem motivated alterations.

<p>
With each figure, I use red disks to indicate the "powered" wheel, and 
the travel of the feet around the pedal crank.  I use a  green disk to identify 
the wheel that steers, and green for any major frame components that move 
together with the wheel during a steer.  The remainder of the frame is 
depicted in dark gray.
</font>

<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 2.1 - RWD - SWB </b></font>

<p>
<font face="arial"> 
One of the first "equations" we can write for recumbents is that RWD = VLC 
(very long chain).  I consider this to be a largely negative feature (the entire 
chain-path must be protected from interference with body and clothing, 
and it requires many intermediate and noisy chain-guiding rollers).   It is 
largely unavoidable with Rear-Wheel-Drive recumbents, both for short 
and long wheelbase designs.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-5c-rwd-swb.png" alt="Rear-Wheel-Drive with Short-Wheelbase"> </center>
<p>
Refer to figure 5c for the most general Rear Wheel Drive, Short Wheelbase design.  
Notice that the short wheelbase is accomplished by placing the pedal crank above 
and forward of the front wheel.  This allows the rider to address the steering directly 
at the steering tube, as with an upright bicycle.  However, the frame must pass well 
over the front wheel to place the pedal crank in this forward position, and the entire 
pedal foot-travel (large red disk) must also be kept above and away from the front 
wheel itself, to avoid interference of feet with the wheel as it swings left and right 
during steer.  Thus, one tends to see a small front wheel used in this design (smaller 
still, if front wheel suspension travel is to be accommodated.)  Raising the feet this 
high demands that the rest of the rider be lifted up as well, so that the feet can at 
least be kept to a height no greater than that of the seat.  Hence, this is generally 
not a "low profile" design.  Also, as the rider's upper legs must straddle the steering 
tube, the handlebars must either rise uncomfortably high to allow for knee movement, 
or else "under seat steering" (USS) must be employed.  I find both of these steering 
alternatives, and the generally small front wheel, to be "sub-optimal".
</font>

<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 2.2 - RWD - LWB </b></font>

<p>
<font face="arial"> 
Figure 5d depicts the Long Wheelbase alternative for Rear Wheel Drive.  
Here, the pedal crank is maintained at a lower altitude by placing the front 
wheel ahead of the pedals.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-5d-rwd-lwb.png" alt="Rear-Wheel-Drive with Long-Wheelbase"> </center>
<p>
The major downside to this design is generally the wheelbase itself - a long wheelbase 
demands a longer (and heavier) frame, heavier due both to the increased length and to 
the need to make it "beefier" to reduce flexing.  Also, in order to make the steering 
tube axis (rake angle) approximate that of a good standard bicycle, a means of steering 
the front wheel "remotely", via chain or other linkage, is often employed.  One positive 
note regarding LWB design is that it allows for a great flexibility in certain specifics.  
In principle, one could lower the rider as much as desired, recline the rider further, 
and even use larger wheel diameters with this design - but each of these things would 
require making an already long frame even longer.  Lastly, a long (and low) frame risks 
the bike "bottoming out" when navigating uneven and rolling surfaces, and making sharp 
turns to navigate crowded spaces is obviously problematic.  For these reasons, LWB 
designs are more fit for specialized racing considerations than for the casual cyclist, 
and I tend to reject LWB designs when considering the "ideal" sport/touring recumbent.
</font>

<p>
<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 2.3 - FWD - SWB (FWS)</b></font>

<p>
<font face="arial"> 
The solution to "Very Long Chain" is to power the front wheel, as this is the general 
location of one's feet in a recumbent position.  Unfortunately (for most designs), the 
front wheel is also the wheel that is expected to effect steering.  The "lateral inflexibility" 
of chain drive means that the pedal crank must be kept fixed in, and perpendicular to 
the plane of the wheel being driven.  Hence, as one steers the front wheel left and right, 
the entire pedal system must swing left and right along with the wheel.  This places 
interesting constraints on front wheel drive bicycle designs.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-5e-fwd-fws.png" alt="Front-Wheel-Drive with Front-Wheel-Steer"> </center>
<p>
With the rider seated on the "rear" of the frame, and behind the axis of the steering tube 
(figure 5e), the rider must "pivot" in their seat during a steer.  Seats that pivot are made 
to accommodate this design.  However, as (say) rightward steering is increased, the 
distance from the seat to the right-half of the pedal crank becomes shorter than the 
distance to the left side of the crank.  Ones legs must adjust, I would say "unnaturally", 
to accommodate such a steering arrangement.  This situation can be (almost) eliminated 
by placing the steering tube further back, at a rake-angle closer to 45 degrees.  This 
allows the rider's upper body to be "seated" more directly above the steering pivot 
point and in line with the steering axis, reducing the "length-changing" effect (see figure 5f).  
This design is employed in the "Flevobike", and probably comes closest to optimizing the 
"rear-seated" front wheel drive design.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-5e-fwd-fws-flevo.png" alt="Front-Wheel-Drive with Front-Wheel-Steer (Flevo)"> </center>
<p>
These FWD designs still have some drawbacks.  First among these is that, as the feet 
alternate pedal force left and right during acceleration, the front frame of the bike wants 
to "steer" (right and left, respectively) at the same time, a condition I refer to as "unwanted 
pedal steer".  The rider must try to control this effect through a countermanding force 
applied to the steering.  While pedal steer is minimized with the Flevobike design, I do 
not believe it can be eliminated entirely, due to the fact that the rider is seated on the rear 
of the frame.  As well, the need for the rider to be behind, and above the steering tube 
location means using a smaller front wheel, or else raising the pedal crank (and thus 
the rider) to a higher position.

But who says you must "ride in the back"?  Why not take the front seat?

<p>
A radical alternative for Front Wheel Drive design is the Kalle FWD, "Rear Wheel Steer" 
design.  I quote the words "Rear Wheel Steer" because (as one person wrote) the Kalle 
can be thought of as front wheel steer - with the rider positioned on the handle bars.  
Note that the position of the steering tube allows the bike to maintain a reasonable 
steering geometry.  I will call this Rear Wheel Steer, precisely because the rider remains 
in fixed alignment to the front wheel (and pedal crank) during a steer, while it is the rear 
wheel that moves "out of alignment" with the rider during steer.
<p>

<p>
Unlike the rear-seated FWD designs, the Kalle allows the rider to be "one" with the 
drive system (pedal crank and drive wheel) while steering.  More so than the Flevobike, 
this design entirely eliminates both the "seat-to-pedals length-changing" effect during steer, 
and the unwanted pedal-steering effect, as the rider, the seat, front wheel and pedal crank 
are all a fixed part of the front "steering unit."

<p>
The Kalle design also tends to place the steering tube at an increased rake-angle, 
superficially similar to the Flevobike.  However, while the Flevobike tends toward this 
arrangement to minimize leg-distortion and pedal steer, the Kalle does so for a very 
different reason.  Recall section 1.2 above regarding steering lift.  We discussed how 
steering lift is largely a function of rake-angle and wheel offset, and why both large 
negative and large positive steering lift should be avoided.  This "proclamation" holds 
true for most bikes, because the rider is seated on the rear of the frame, and only rises 
(or falls) to a fractional degree, determined geometrically by the orbit of the steering center.  
In contrast, the Kalle rider moves with the front wheel during a steer.  A configuration 
of rake and offset that would produce almost flat "geometric" steering lift (such as with 
a standard upright bicycle) could result in enormous "effective" steering lift if the rider 
sat atop the handle bars and well behind the steering tube.  If one imagines a vertical 
steering tube, the rider could sit anywhere "off axis" and not rise as they rotate around 
the axis.  But if the axis is tilted back, and the rider is back behind (and below) this axis, 
rotation about the axis must lift the rider upward.  This would result in considerable 
resistance to any increase of steering angle.  Two ways to mitigate this effect are either 
to decrease the wheel offset for any given rake angle (resulting in negative geometric 
steering lift to compensate for the rider's lift with respect to the frame) or to move the 
rider's center of gravity closer to the steering axis.  Some combination of both of these 
should result in the "sweet spot" that provides a nearly flat, or slightly positive steering lift.

<p>
However, when it comes to rider seating height and front wheel diameter, these "Kalle" 
designs suffer from the same issues that the rear-seated FWD designs must negotiate - 
the steering tube must remain above and behind the front wheel center in order to 
maintain reasonable steering axis and rake, and then the rider must remain atop this 
point in order that the steering components can move freely left and right beneath the rider.  
As well, the front frame must pass well over the front wheel to mount the pedal crank 
in the desired location (and more so if front wheel suspension travel is to be accommodated).  
These considerations generally force FWD designs, whether "Flevo" or "Kalle", to settle for 
a smaller front wheel, and even this only partially addresses the "high rider" issue.

<p>
Can we "solve" both of these remaining problems?  At once?

<font size="5" face="Arial" ><b> 2.5 - The Z-Bike </b></font>

<p>
<font face="arial"> 
Here, I propose two "radical" modifications to the Kalle FWD-RWS design,
in a design I have designated the "Z-Bike".

<p>
The first of these modifications is not terribly radical, and certainly has its own weight-related 
downside.  Construct the front frame to straddle both sides of the front wheel while remaining 
open at the top, allowing the wheel to move up and past the top of the frame for suspension 
travel, and allowing the crank to maintain a lower position forward of the front wheel.

<p>
This "split frame" (in itself) would not allow for a much larger front wheel, nor a much 
lower rider position, as the rider's legs must still reach across the wheel diameter and 
allow room for the steering tube.  Larger front wheel and lower crank position only 
becomes possible when the rider can get closer and "more intimate" with the front 
wheel, a generally impossible situation, because there is then no room to place the 
steering tube and allow the rear steering assembly to move freely beneath the rider.
<p>
<UL><B> Solution - Eliminate the Steering Tube </B></UL>
<p>
With the Z-Bike, the steering tube is replaced by a pair of swiveling arms in a 
trapezoidal arrangement (see figure 6).  This steering mechanism can be placed 
well behind the location of the would-be steering tube, and at various elevations, 
yet it will cause the bike to "fold" at a point that approximates the standard 
steering tube position - what I will call the "phantom steering tube" or 
"phantom steering axis".  One can adjust the "phantom" rake angle directly by 
the angle in which the steering assembly mounts to the front frame, and can 
adjust the "phantom" front steering offset either by the selection of mount point, 
or by the length of the swivel arms employed, or even by the ratio between the 
separation of the front steering pivots and the rear steering pivots.
<p>
<a> <center> <img src="https://psychotechnica.github.io/images/zbike/zb-6-zbike-steering.png" alt="Z-Bike Trapezoidal Steering"> </center>
<p>
Figure 6a illustrates the steering arrangement of a standard upright bicycle, 
from a "top view" (actually, from a view that aligns with the steering tube, 
depicted as a red circle offset from the front wheel center).  The "rear frame" 
is depicted in blue, and the horizontal gray line maintains the front and rear 
wheel ground contact points.  With figure 6b, a 30-degree left steer is shown 
(with bike held vertical).  Notice that the steering tube has shifted to the right, 
and that the rear wheel is actually "steering" about 4 degrees to the right.  
This has also resulted in moving the rear wheel forward, shortening the wheelbase 
by some fraction of an inch.  (Of course, in a "real" 30 degree steer, the bike 
would be canted over to the left, and the wheel contact points would move further 
apart, actually increasing the effective wheelbase.)

<p>
Figure 6c illustrates the Z-Bike steering mechanism, before steering is applied.  
Note that the two steering arms (depicted in red) form a trapezoid, as the pivot 
points near the front wheel are closer together than those near the rear wheel.  
With figure 6d, a 30-degree left steer is shown.  The large red circle on the 
front wheel indicates where a "standard" steering tube would appear, and is 
now the "phantom" steering tube.  Note that at 30 degrees of steer, the rear 
wheel still steers about 4 degrees to the right, and remains pointing (approximately) 
to the phantom steering tube, as if the rear frame was rotating about that point.  
(Note also, the "double-bent" shape of the frame during a steer is reminiscent 
of the letter "Z", hence the "Z-Bike" name.)
<p>
With any solution, new "problems" appear.  There are indeed drawbacks to the 
Z-bike mechanism.  Careful examination of figure 6 would show that, as steering 
is increased, the "phantom" steering tube actually drifts backward a bit (increasing 
the front steering offset), and the rear wheel has moved several inches closer to 
the front of the bike, diminishing the wheelbase and causing steering to increase 
the degree of turn effected.  (Alternately, one could argue that less "steer" is 
needed to effect an equivalently sharp turn for the bicycle as a whole.)  
In any case, geometry will show that these effects can be reduced by lengthening 
the two steering arms and moving the mechanism back a bit further from the front 
wheel, at the expense of lengthening the overall wheelbase.

<p>
Another potential drawback to the trapezoid-arms steering system is that it is 
very difficult to obtain an effective steering angle of more than about 50 degrees.  
Of course, one rarely applies such a sharp steering angle except when practically 
at a standstill, or walking the bike, and by then the bike's overall wheelbase will 
have been reduced to such an extent that 50 degrees provides for a very small 
turning radius, such as one might obtain at 60-65 degrees of steer for a standard bike.

<p>
Of course, a more general drawback to the Z-bike design is simply its structural 
considerations.  Although it affords a rather sleek, "compact" and unified framework, 
that framework is still rather substantial, weight-wise.  With its additional complexity 
comes additional expense – the single thrust-bearing-housed steering tube of a standard 
bicycle becomes four such (albeit smaller) tube-assemblies with the Z-Bike, to 
accommodate the four pivot-points of the trapezoidal steering mechanism.  
In its favor, one could design an adjustable mount point (location and angle) for 
the front pivot assembly, along with "replacement" pivot arms of various lengths, 
that would easily allow one to create a very wide range of bicycle geometries.

<p>
On another positive note, notice that this design allows the pedal crank to be 
further ahead of the front wheel, and lower, than with any other FWD design.  
Since the chain travel from crank to wheel most be kept relatively constant, a 
suitable front suspension (that does not jar the rider's feet) demands that it pivot 
very close to the crank.  Other FWD designs must place the crank so far above 
the front wheel, that such suspension travel moves the wheel more "backwards" 
than upwards, an issue that is addressed well in the Z-bike design.

<p>
There is one more issue that must be mentioned with all "Kalle" type bicycles.  
For all RWD bikes, the front wheel can be steered "very rapidly" to the left or 
right if desired, since it is only the front wheel, fork and handlebars that are at play.  
However, with the Kalle (and to a lesser extent, all FWD designs) far more mass 
exists to be rotated to effect a change of steer.  Although we might call Kalle-type 
designs "rear wheel steer", we fully expect that as we pull upon the handlebars it will 
be the front section (and rider with it) that performs most of the "turning".  There is a 
danger that, with too much front-loading of weight, together with the angular inertia 
presented by the rider, an attempt at a "sudden left-hand steer" might cause the rear 
section to slide to the left, rather than stay put and allow the front section to turn left.  
Mitigating this potential requires moving the rider back and increasing the "recumbency" 
(moving more weight toward the rear), while ensuring that the majority of the rider's 
mass remain as close as possible to the steering axis (real or phantom).  This (once again) 
leads us toward a bit smaller front wheel.
<p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
Having confessed to its variable deficiencies, I feel that the Z-Bike "solves" the 
major issues I see with the standard Kalle design (and other recumbent designs in general).
<p>
In summary, the Z-Bike accommodates all of the following design goals:

<p>
<UL>
<LI> A reasonable recumbent position, with feet 6 to 12 inches below the hips.
<LI> A reasonably low rider position
<LI> Unified rider-to-pedal-crank framework (no fighting between pedals and steering).
<LI> Potentially large wheel diameters
<LI> Short wheelbase
<LI> Front wheel drive (hence minimal chain length)
<LI> Amenability to full suspension
<LI> A steering-trail and steering-lift geometry that can provide the natural balance of the finer upright bicycles.
</UL>
<p>
Given the outlined Z-Bike design, there exists room for further innovations 
(a variety of specific mechanisms to apply steering force to the trapezoidal 
steering system can be developed, for example.)  But whatever improvements 
exist to be made, I believe they will center around the Z-Bike configuration on 
a path to the ultimate sport-touring recumbent.
<p>

Here is a detail view of a potential steering mechanism, using a ball-and-socket linkage between the handlebar pivot arm and the trapezoidal steering arm.

<p>
<p>
It may be counter-intuitive to view this image and SEE the virtual steering axis.  One tends to imagine that the bike could fold (rotate)
independently about either the front, or rear steering pivots.  However, the trapezoid location of the 4 pivots actually constrains the
steering arms so that they cannot pivot independently, and the bike is thus forced to behave as if a steering tube were present along the
indicated green line.
<p>
<p>
Here are several images that show the Z-bike in various degrees of steering (and canting.)  Each sequence of four images depicts 
0, 10, 20 and 30 degrees of steer, in concert with 0, 10, 20 and 30 degrees of front wheel canting (leaning) into a turn.
<p>
NOTE:  If you download these images and save them to a separate folder, you can view them with (say) Windows Picture and Fax Viewer
(surely the Mac has something similar), and rapidly click the next-image button to get a sense of the bike as its steering is increased.
